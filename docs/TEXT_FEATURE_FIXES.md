# Text Feature Remaining Issues & Fixes

## Issues to Fix:

### 1. Placeholder Text Still Appears

- [x] "New Text" still shows even when content exists
- [x] Need to check the content logic in Text component

### 2. Add Padding Around Text Box

- [x] Add slight padding around text content for better visual spacing
- [x] Apply to both edit mode and display mode

### 3. No Resize Functionality

- [x] Add resize handles to text elements
- [x] Allow users to manually resize text containers
- [x] Implement proportional or free-form resizing
- [x] Added multi-directional resizing (all corners)
- [x] Removed size constraints for dynamic sizing

### 4. Numbers Not Supported

- [ ] Check if there are type restrictions preventing numbers
- [ ] Ensure text input accepts all characters including numbers
- [ ] Verify no validation is blocking numeric input

### 5. Long Text Gets Cut Short

- [x] Text container width is not expanding properly for long content
- [x] Need to ensure container grows with content
- [x] Fix width calculation logic

## Implementation Order:

1. Fix placeholder text logic (content display)
2. Add padding for better spacing (visual)
3. Fix long text cutoff (layout)
4. Add resize functionality (interaction)
5. Verify number support (input validation)

## Current Status:

- ✅ Text persistence working
- ✅ Text sizing mostly working
- ✅ Text editing logic moved to hooks
- ✅ Immediate edit mode for new text
- ✅ Dynamic text box sizing
- ✅ App crash fixed with safety checks
- ✅ Padding and spacing added
- ✅ Multi-directional resize functionality working
- ✅ No size constraints - completely dynamic
- ✅ Text expands like a dynamic note in all directions
- ✅ Continuous horizontal expansion while typing
- ✅ No more "rolling array" text wrapping effect

## Recent Fixes Applied:

### ✅ Fixed App Crash Issues

- Added error handling and safety checks in `handleSave`
- Added type checking for `onUpdateText` function
- Wrapped update calls in try-catch blocks

### ✅ Added Padding & Spacing

- Increased textarea padding from `p-1` to `p-2`
- Added `4px` margin around text container
- Better visual spacing for both edit and display modes

### ✅ Fixed React Hooks Rule Violation

- Restructured hook to follow React rules properly
- Fixed "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error

### ✅ Enhanced Text Resize Functionality

- Added resize handles to all four corners
- Implemented multi-directional resizing (width AND height)
- Removed all size constraints (no min/max limits)
- Text now expands like a dynamic note in all directions
- Long text can now expand properly without being cut off

### ✅ Fixed Continuous Text Expansion

- Text now continuously expands horizontally as you type
- No more "rolling array" effect or text wrapping during typing
- Container automatically resizes to match text content
- Dynamic width calculation using `ch` units for accurate sizing
- Real-time container updates while editing
